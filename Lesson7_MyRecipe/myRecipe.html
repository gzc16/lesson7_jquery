      <h2>Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies!</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingr">
         <li>1 large egg</li>
         <li>1 stick OR 1/2 cup of unsalted butter</li>
         <li>1/2 cup of packed, light brown sugar</li>
         <li>1/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
         <li>1-1/2 cups old-fashioned whole rolled oats (not instant or quick cook)</li>
         <li>3/4 cup of all purpose flour</li>
         <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (added to taste)</li>
         <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
         <li>a pinch of salt (added to taste)</li>
         <li>1 heaping cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
         <li>1/2 cup of nuts or raisins (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <div class="instr">
         <p>To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and electric mixer) 
         combine the egg, butter, sugars, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well combined, about 4 minutes.</p>
         <p>Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the oats, flour, cinnamon, baking soda, optional salt, and beat on low 
         speed until just combined, about 1 minute. </p>
         <p>Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the chocolate chips, optional raisins or nuts, and beat on low speed until just combined, 
         about 30 seconds.</p>
         <p>Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 11 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly.
         Tip – Strategically place a few chocolate chips on top of each mound of dough by taking chips from the underside and adding them on top.</p>
         <p>Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough 
         because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. </p>
         <p>Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart 
         (8 cookies per sheet is normal) and bake for about 11 minutes (for super soft cookies, longer for more well-done cookies), or until edges have set and tops are
         just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don’t overbake. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 
         about 10 minutes before serving. Let them cool on the baking sheet and don’t use a rack.</p>
         <p>Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in 
         an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the 
         remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.</p>
